Kevin knew that something was wrong as he approached the house. Even though it was a dark night, he saw fresh footprints leading to the back door of the building. He also noticed several light sources through windows and some noise coming from there. Kevin suspected that there were thieves in his home.

Standing near the back door, he had to decide what to do quickly. He was confident and calm as he was a well-trained policeman. He phoned +1202-426-6710 to inform the police station that his house had been broken into.

Kevin wasn't wearing his uniform, but he always carried a gun, handcuffs, and his police badge. So, he prepared for a possible attack and arrest and then walked into the house and said: "It's the police! Hands up!"

Surprisingly, there were no burglars. There were his colleagues and Captain. They were holding the "Happy Birthday!" poster. But as they knew Kevin well, all of them were fully equipped, even wearing bulletproof vests. "Oh!" Kevin exclaimed. He did not expect this. He even forgot that it was his birthday.

Later, Captain asked all his officers to make a report on the incident because it was also a test on Kevin's stress reaction after vacation. So, Kevin was happy that colleagues congratulated him, but he was surprised with the way of doing it.
