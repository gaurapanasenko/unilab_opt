Modern educational establishments should consider an alternative method of teaching students in which students have no homework assignments. I believe this way of studying has several benefits for students. They can improve their skills and plan their spare time freely. Also, teachers have whole-time control of the learning process.

First of all, students are trained to solve tasks in real-time mode. It helps the student learn how to make things fast and not to spend much time on simple tasks. Also, there is always the possibility to ask the teacher or colleague and not to get stuck if you do not know something.

The most exciting aspect is that students can plan free time as they wish. They have more time to relax or study in their own manner. And there is no stress when a student does not want to do some work and puts it off until the last moment.

Another interesting point is that the teacher sees how students do some work and can control this process. Teachers can advise on speeding up the job, so the efficiency of learning increases.

In conclusion, I think that learning without homework has an attractive perspective for students and would not do any harm to their results.
