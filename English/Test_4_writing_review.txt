Free Guy is an action comedy film with the elements of science fiction, directed by Shawn Levy and starring Rian Raynolds. This movie is set in modern times and tells about a non-playable character that got consciousness and the ability to think not only as he was programmed. At the same time, he discovers that his world will be erased and replaced with a new version. So, he puts effort to save it.

The film starts by showing the life of the average bank worker named Guy. There is a usual world where a lot of strange things happen. Аfterwards, the viewer discovers that the world is a game and a person is a non-playable character. And suddenly Guy starts to react unusually, thinking and changing his behaviour. So, he becomes a hero for this world because he has to protect his friends from players’ violence. Laters, Guy finds out that he is not a real person but an NPC character and this game is going to be destroyed. After realizing that, he tries to save his world, so the viewers will dive into the set of amazing adventures together with the hero.

The film touches on an interesting issue of how intelligence develops. So, it makes viewers consider how we think and how we get conscious of ourselves as a person. It shows how thoughts work and how new information is processed, how we get new reactions and habits. And there was a very touching moment when Guy understood that his world was not real. The movie is emotional and deep, mostly due to the captivating plot with unexpected twists as well as the convincing acting. Also, this film has spectacular graphics. Another fascinating effect is that the game is shown as the real world and not as a computer game.

I definitely recommend seeing Free Guy to everyone who likes adventures and science fiction and is interested in the topic of artificial intelligence. The film is worth seeing and will give you a couple of hours of fun and a spark of ideas afterward.
