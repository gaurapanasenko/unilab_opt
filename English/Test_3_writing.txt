There is an opinion that mobile phones should be blocked in public places. However, I do not think it is a good idea. Mobile phones allow people to communicate in different places and conditions. Also, they help get entertained and support people in emergencies.

Firstly, from the communication perspective, modern mobile phones are now far beyond actual talks because people can also use them for texting and communicating in messengers. So, in public places, itâ€™s quite easy to avoid loud talks and you can keep quiet but still keep in touch with your friends and relatives. 

Secondly, most mobile phones help spend time with fun while waiting for someone or something. We can use smartphones for entertainment such as playing games, listening to music, or watching videos. In public places, we often face the problem of expecting in queues, waiting for our flight or train, or having to wait for somebody who is late. In this case, the mobile phone lets you kill that time with fun and without irritation.

Thirdly, mobile phones can literally save a life. In case of emergency, you can call for an ambulance or the police. It can help kids that got lost to find their parents or teachers, or people can inform somebody about dangerous situations in the public place. Last but not least, you can use it for navigation and finding your way.

In conclusion, the above-mentioned points prove that mobile phones are helpful and should not be banned. We live in the world where smartphones are a part of daily life, so it is not logical to ban them in the places where they help most of all. If this happens, life will be more difficult.
