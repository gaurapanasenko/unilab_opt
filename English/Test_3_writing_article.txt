My Strangest Hobby: Photo Editing

For most people, it is important to have a hobby that helps them relax and switch from work or daily chores, isnâ€™t it? I am also a person who has such a hobby, and I bet that mine is weirder than yours. My hobby is photo and pictures editing. Sometimes, I refine photos by making them brighter, for example, or, I change colours to some wallpapers.

I like this type of hobby because for me it is very relaxing and sometimes useful. My job is programming, so it usually has logical tasks. At work, I need to concentrate on thinking rather than using my imagination to program something. However, when I edit some photos or images, I can use my creativity and only a few skills in image manipulator. So, the logical part of my brain is resting in the process. I just need to come up with an idea.

And what do I need for my hobby? First of all, I use my smartphone camera to take photos, or sometimes, I experiment with photos sent by my friends. For image manipulations, I have GIMP software, which is free to use. Have you ever thought of how many different things can be done to improve one single photo from your phone? It is possible to make the photo more realistic. Or, you can make a photocopy of the high quality, comparable to the one made by a scanner and good for printing. It is fantastic what modern smartphone cameras can do and how many opportunities they open for image-editing!

Based on my experience, I want to say that it's advisable to have a hobby that differs from the tasks you usually do. And, I believe it is good when it is practical and you can use it in life. What do you think?
