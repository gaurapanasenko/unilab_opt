Nowadays, new technologies opened a better way of shopping compared to shopping on High Street as you can purchase new stuff on the Internet. I agree that shopping online is better than going to the stores although both options have pros and cons, differing in convenience, safety, and time spending.

On the one hand, searching for things in online shops is more comfortable than moving around malls and stores. You can see all options online, compare them and then buy the best choice. On the other hand, not all online shops give the corresponding information about their goods. It is a usual situation when an item has an improper description. So, it is not the same experience as when you come to the High Street shop and can see and touch all the goods, which means that online buyers have to be more careful.

One more aspect to consider is safety. In online shopping, there is some risk that you pay for the goods but do not get them. Or you can get an incomplete delivery. In the real shop, you physically see and touch the goods, pack them in your bag, and pay for them right there. 

The best thing about online shopping is that it saves a lot of time. You do not need to waste your time getting to the shops or jumping from one store to another. Whatâ€™s more, you can get everything you buy delivered to your home which also saves some time and effort.

Therefore, my thought is that people should get most things via the Internet. However, they must be very careful and check packages as soon as they receive them.
